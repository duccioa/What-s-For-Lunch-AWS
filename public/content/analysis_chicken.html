     <p><strong>Chicken</strong></p>
<p>Results show a very distinct spatial pattern of food business names containing the word &lsquo;chicken&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The location quotient measure of relative concentration shows chicken is definitely on the menu for lunch in the north-east, far north-west and south of the city. On the other hand, chicken is conspicuously absent in the inner west corridor along the river, the roads around Chalk Farm and Hampstead Heath, and the south-east regions of the city. Local Moran&rsquo;s I values show significant clustering along corridors stretching into the north-east and southern regions of the city.</p>
<p>There is a strong negative correlation between the relative concentration (location quotient) of food business names containing the word &lsquo;chicken&rsquo; and median ward income, showing that fried chicken is more likely to be on the menu for lunch in lower socio-economic areas.</p>
