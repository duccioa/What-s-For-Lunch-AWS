     <p><strong>Grill</strong></p>
<p>Results show that food businesses containing the word &lsquo;grill&rsquo; are heavily concentrated in the inner city areas and also along the inner east corridor.</p>
<p>Local Moran&rsquo;s values for spatial autocorrelation shows clustering of wards in the inner city and inner south where there are similar and very high densities of food businesses containing the word &lsquo;grill&rsquo;, and clustering in the outer wards where there are similar and lower densities. This pattern is not unexpected given the high number of food businesses in the inner city compared to the outer limits. In addition, there are significantly clustered values of higher densities in the inner east corridor and far south of the city.</p>
<p>There is a slight and inconclusive negative correlation between the relative concentration (location quotient) of food business names containing the word &lsquo;grill&rsquo; and median ward income.</p>
