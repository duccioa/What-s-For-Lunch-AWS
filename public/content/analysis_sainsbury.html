     <p><strong>Sainsbury&rsquo;s</strong></p>
     <p>All metrics for the analysis of the location of Sainsbury&rsquo;s stores shows a relatively dispersed pattern with some concentration in the inner north and dispersion around the middle ring of the city. There is very little correlation between relative concentration (location quotient) measure for Sainsbury&rsquo;s stores and median ward income suggesting that they are store locations are not targeting a specific socio-economic market.</p>
