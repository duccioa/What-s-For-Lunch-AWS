     <p><strong>Fried</strong></p>
 <p>Results show a very distinct spatial pattern of food business names containing the word &lsquo;fried&rsquo;. Unsurprisingly, this pattern almost mirrors that for food business names containing the word &lsquo;chicken&rsquo;.</p>
 <p>The location quotient measure of relative concentration shows fried food is definitely on the menu for lunch in the north-east, far north-west and south of the city. On the other hand, food business names containing the word fried are relatively rare in the western half of the city. Local Moran&rsquo;s I values show significant clustering along corridors stretching into the north-east and southern regions of the city.</p>
 <p>There is a strong negative correlation between the relative concentration (location quotient) of food business names containing the word &lsquo;fried&rsquo; and median ward income, showing that fried food is more likely to be on the menu for lunch in lower-socio economic areas.</p>
