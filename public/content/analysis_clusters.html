        <p><strong>Neighbourhoods classification</strong></p>
<p>Using a hieratical clustering algorithm for the variables income, and the measures of relative concentration (location quotient) of food business names containing words &lsquo;coffee&rsquo;, &lsquo;chicken&rsquo;, &lsquo;Thai&rsquo; and &lsquo;kebab&rsquo;, wards of the city could be grouped under four distinct categories which can be described as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Established Gentrified. </strong>Already affluent or gentrified areas of the city. These areas are typified by a high income, and love of coffee and East Asian food. Typical areas include Chelsea, Kew, Paddington and Marylebone.</p>
<p><strong>Emergent Gentrification</strong>. These areas typically have a lower median income but nevertheless exhibit similar food preferences to the established affluent areas of London.&nbsp; Typical areas include Hammersmith, Acton, Highbury and Islington, Alexandra Palace and Wimbledon</p>
<p><strong>Non-gentrified.</strong> These areas typically have a lower median income and display a stronger preference for the fried chicken and kebabs.&nbsp; This category is typified by areas such as Tottenham in north London and Westham in the east.</p>
<p><strong>Balanced Diet.</strong> These are relatively affluent areas but are not too fussed either with fancy sushi or coffee places or overdoing the fried food. This category is typified by outer wards such as Edgeware, Totteridge and Cockfosters.</p>
