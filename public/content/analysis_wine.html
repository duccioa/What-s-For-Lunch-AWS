     <p><strong>Wine</strong></p>
     <p>It appears that wine appeals to most of London&rsquo;s residents with food businesses containing the word &lsquo;wine&rsquo; relatively evenly distributed across the city.</p>
     <p>Local Moran&rsquo;s I values for spatial autocorrelation shows clustering of wards in the inner-city and inner south where there similar and very high densities of food businesses containing the word wine, and clustering in the outer wards where there are similar and lower densities. This pattern is not unexpected, given the high number of food businesses in the inner-city compared to the outer limits. Nevertheless, significant clustering of high values extends further south to the area around Crystal Palace, an area outside the influence of the inner-city.</p>
     <p>Values for the location quotient, which moderates the effect of the inner-city, normalizing by the total number of food businesses, shows a relatively even spread across London, although conspicuously low values for relative concentration in the far south-east corner.</p>
     <p>There is a slight and inconclusive negative correlation between the relative concentration (location quotient) of food business names containing the word &lsquo;wine&rsquo; and median ward income.</p>
