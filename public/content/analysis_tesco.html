     <p><strong>Tesco</strong></p>
     <p>All metrics for the analysis of the location of Tesco stores show heavy concentration in the inner city and inner western corridor through Fulham to Hammersmith. Tesco stores are otherwise relatively evenly spread throughout the remainder of the city. There is a slight and inconclusive negative correlation between the relative concentration (location quotient) of Tesco outlets and median ward income suggesting that they are store locations are not targeting a specific socio-economic market.</p>
