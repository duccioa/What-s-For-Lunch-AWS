     <p><strong>Fish</strong></p>
     <p>Perhaps unsurprising, given the Brits&rsquo; famous love of fish and chips, food businesses containing the word &lsquo;fish&rsquo; are mostly evenly distributed across the city.</p>
     <p>Local Moran&rsquo;s I values for spatial autocorrelation show clustering of wards in the inner city and inner south where there are similar and very high densities of food businesses containing the word fish, and clustering in the outer wards where there are similar and lower densities. This pattern is not unexpected, given the high number of food businesses in the inner city compared to the outer limits.</p>
     <p>Values for the location quotient, which moderates the effect of the inner city, normalizing by the total number of food businesses, shows that there are actually relatively fewer food business names containing the word fish in the inner city and a fairly even spread of businesses across the rest of the city.</p>
     <p>There is a moderate negative correlation between the relative concentration (location quotient) of food business names containing the word fish and median ward income, nevertheless, the results show that pretty much wherever you are in London, fish and chips will be on the menu for lunch.</p>
