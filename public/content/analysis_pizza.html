     <p><strong>Pizza </strong></p>
     <p>Food businesses containing the word &lsquo;pizza&rsquo; are mostly evenly distributed across the city, although more prevalent north of the river.</p>
     <p>Local Moran&rsquo;s I values for spatial autocorrelation shows clustering of wards in the inner city and inner south where there are similar and very high densities of food businesses containing the word pizza, and clustering in the outer wards where there are similar and lower densities. This pattern is not unexpected, given the high number of food businesses in the inner-city compared to the outer limits. Nevertheless, the inner south-eastern corridor also shows particularly significant clustering in the areas stretching from Lambeth to Battersea.</p>
     <p>Values for the location quotient, which moderates the effect of the inner city, normalizing by the total number of food businesses, show that there are relatively slightly fewer food business names containing the word pizza in the inner city and a fairly even spread of business across the rest of the city.</p>
     <p>There is a slight negative correlation between the relative concentration (location quotient) of food business names containing the word pizza and median ward income; nevertheless, the results show that pretty much wherever you are in London, pizza will be on the menu for lunch.</p>
