<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>
                            This is an exploration of food habits of Londoners, depending on their income and their area of residency. The rationale behind the project is that different social classes have different consumption patterns, hence demand different types of retail. We tried to catch these differences by looking at the name of these premises and the appearance of some specific words. We considered the business names of more than 10000 food premises across London, split them in single words and analysed the spatial distribution of these words in comparison with the distribution of household income levels. We identified fifteen words that were likely to have some interesting patterns and for each of them we studied the correlation with income.

<h2>Background:</h2>
<p>Gentrification: The term used to describe the phenomenon where many traditionally working-class and industrial areas of the inner city are becoming dominated by middle-class residents.
In addition to renovated flats, it is widely noted that areas that become gentrified experience a broad cultural shift. Retail and entertainment spaces change to suit consumer tastes. Boutique coffee shops replace standard fried food joints. These retailers are held up as symbols of gentrification, becoming the focus of social unrest caused by the pricing out of low-income residents, such as the infamous protest at the Shoreditch &lsquo;Cereal Killer Caf&eacute;&rsquo; in late 2015. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>London-Wide Statistical Overview</h2>
<p>This project applied statistical and spatial analysis techniques to common words found in the names of food businesses in London (Food Standards Agency Database). The resulting analysis reveals strong spatial segregation in consumer preferences for common food business types across high and low income areas. From these results, a four category classification for London wards has been developed based on a clustering of significant variables.
Initial exploration of the data reveals that the word &lsquo;caf&eacute;&rsquo; is by far the most common single word in London food business names, followed by &lsquo;food&rsquo;, &lsquo;restaurant&rsquo; and &lsquo;bar&rsquo;. Scroll over the chart below to reveal all the top 50 most common words.</p>
