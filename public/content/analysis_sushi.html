     <p><strong>Sushi</strong></p>
     <p>Food businesses containing the word &lsquo;sushi&rsquo; are almost exclusively a phenomenon of the inner-city and inner western corridor stretching through Chelsea, Kensington and Hammersmith.</p>
     <p>Local Moran&rsquo;s I values for spatial autocorrelation show clustering of wards in the inner-city and wards immediately south of the city where there are similarly high-density values.</p>
     <p>The location quotient which moderates the effect of the inner-city, normalizing by the total number of food businesses, shows that there is still a much greater concentration of sushi stores in the inner-city and inner western corridor relative to the rest of London.</p>
     <p>There is a moderately strong positive correlation between the relative concentration (location quotient) of food business names containing the word &lsquo;sushi&rsquo; and median ward income. In conclusion this analysis shows that sushi is most likely to be on the menu for lunch in affluent inner-city areas.</p>
