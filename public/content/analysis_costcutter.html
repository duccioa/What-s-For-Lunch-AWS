     <p><strong>Costcutter</strong></p>
<p>All metrics for the analysis of the location of Costcutter stores show a relatively dispersed pattern with some concentration in the inner south of the city. Contrary to what the name suggests, there is only a slight negative correlation between the relative concentration (location quotient) measure for Costcutter stores and median ward income.</p>
