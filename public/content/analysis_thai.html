     <p><strong>Thai</strong></p>
     <p>The distribution of food business names containing the word &lsquo;Thai&rsquo; exhibits a unique spatial pattern with a concentration in the inner city, the inner-western corridor stretching right through to Acton and southern areas around Wandsworth and Wimbledon. Local Moran&rsquo;s I values for spatial autocorrelation support this pattern showing significant clustering in these areas. Similarly, the calculations for the location quotient show a greater concentration of food businesses containing the word &lsquo;Thai&rsquo; in these areas relative to the rest of the city.</p>
     <p>There is a strong positive correlation between the relative concentration (location quotient) of food business names containing the word &lsquo;Thai&rsquo; and median ward income, suggesting that preference for Thai food may be indicative of higher socio-economic status.</p>
