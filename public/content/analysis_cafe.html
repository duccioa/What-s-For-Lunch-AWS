     <p><strong>Caf&eacute;</strong></p>
  <p>Our results show that you are likely to find a food business calling itself a &lsquo;caf&eacute;&rsquo; almost anywhere in London where people live and work. Density measures are spread normally across the city wards.</p>
  <p>Local Moran&rsquo;s I values for spatial autocorrelation show clusters of wards in the inner city where there are similar and very high densities of cafes, and clusters in the outer wards where there are similar and very low densities of cafes. This pattern is not unexpected, given the high number of food businesses in the inner city compared to the outer limits.</p>
  <p>The location quotient which moderates the effect of the inner city, normalizing by the total number of food businesses, shows that there is a slightly greater concentration of cafes in the wards north of the central city areas and comparatively fewer in the far west and far east.</p>
  <p>There is no strong correlation between the relative concentration (location quotient) of cafes and the median income of a ward. Contrary to expectations, the analysis shows that the word &lsquo;caf&eacute;&rsquo; alone is not an indicator of the socio-economic status of an area.</p>
