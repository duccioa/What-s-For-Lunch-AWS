     <p><strong>Waitrose</strong></p>
     <p>Metrics for the analysis of the location of Waitrose stores show concentration along the north-west corridor through Hampstead and Finchley, the inner west corridor through Westminster, Chelsea and Hammersmith and also the south-east corridor through Clapham and Wimbledon.</p>
     <p>There is a strong positive correlation between the relative concentration (location quotient) of Waitrose stores and median ward income suggesting that Waitrose targets the preferences of London&rsquo;s higher socio-economic residents.</p>
