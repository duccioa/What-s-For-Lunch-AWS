     <p><strong>Kebab</strong></p>
     <p>Kebab shops are prevalent along a number of key corridors running through the city to the north, north-east, south and far west of the city.</p>
     <p>Local Moran&rsquo;s I values for spatial autocorrelation shows significant clustering of kebab shops in the inner north and inner south-east regions of the city.</p>
     <p>The location quotient measure highlights the northern corridor running through Tottenham, eastern corridor running through Barking, southern areas Lewisham, Bromley looping back west to Croydon, and western areas around Wembley, as areas with a relatively higher concentration of kebab shops.</p>
     <p>There is a strong negative correlation between the relative concentration (location quotient) of food business names containing the word &lsquo;kebab&rsquo; and median ward income, showing that kebabs are more likely to be a lunch item in lower socio-economic areas of the city.</p>
