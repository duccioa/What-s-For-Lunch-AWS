     <p><strong>Coffee</strong></p>
<p>Coffee shops are most commonly found in the inner-city business areas of the city. In addition, the analysis reveals clustering in the inner south-east corridor near Clapham, Balham and Battersea with significantly high values of the local Moran&rsquo;s I.</p>
<p>The location quotient which moderates the effect of the inner city, normalizing by the total number of food businesses, shows that whilst the inner city and inner south-east still dominate, the inner western corridor along the river, and inner northern wards around Chalk Farm and Hampstead Heath, are also coffee loving areas. It is interesting that the pattern shown is almost the inverse of that displayed by food businesses containing the name chicken.</p>
<p>There is a moderate positive correlation between the relative concentration (location quotient) of food business names containing the word coffee and median ward income, suggesting that coffee shops are indicative of higher socio-economic status.</p>
